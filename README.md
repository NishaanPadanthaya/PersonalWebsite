This webpage is  a  basic personal website created using HTML and CSS to showcase the profile of an individual. Here's a brief explanation of the project:

1. **HTML Structure:** The HTML document follows the standard structure for a web page. It includes a document type declaration which sets the language to English, and defines the page's metadata within the section, such as the character encoding, viewport settings, and a title.

2. **Styling:** The website is styled using both an external CSS file called "style.css" and some inline CSS within the HTML document. CSS is used to control the layout, colors, fonts, and backgrounds of various elements on the page.

3. **Header:** The website starts with a header section that includes a greeting ("Hi!"), a profile photo, and a brief introduction of the person ("I am Nishaan Padanthaya").

4. **About Me:** This section provides more information about me, including my passion for technology, sports interests, and hobbies.

5. **Educational Qualifications:** My educational background is listed here, including details about primary school and current pursuit of a B.Tech degree in Computer Science.

6. **Tools:** A section that displays various technology icons representing the tools and technologies Nishaan is familiar with, such as Python, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, scikit-learn, and more.

7. **Connect with Me:** My social media links (GitHub and LinkedIn) are provided as clickable icons. An email address is also included for contact.

8. **Background Image:** Throughout the website, there is a background image (specified in CSS) that adds visual appeal to the design.

9. **CSS Animation:** There is an animation applied to certain headings (h1 and h2 elements) on the page. They have a "coolAnimation" effect that makes them fade in and out repeatedly.
